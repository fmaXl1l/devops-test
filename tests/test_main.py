"""Legacy test file - tests moved to test_unit.py and test_integration.py"""

# This file is kept for backward compatibility
# All tests have been reorganized into:
# - test_unit.py: Unit tests for individual components
# - test_integration.py: Integration tests for endpoints
# - conftest.py: Shared fixtures and configuration

# To run tests, use:
# pytest tests/
# pytest tests/test_unit.py
# pytest tests/test_integration.py
